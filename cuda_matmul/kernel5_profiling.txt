A100 Metrics:
Compute Limit: 19,500 GFLOPs
Memory Limit: 2,000 GB/s

MY Analysis:
    FLOPS = 2 * 4096 ^ 3 = 137 billion GFLOPS
    Time = 12.37 ms
    Performance = 137B / 0.01237 = 11,059 GFLOPS
    This is 11,059 / 19500 = 56.7% of peak capacity (2x improvement compared to kernel 4, huge jump!)
    Speedup: 1.92x vs Kernel 4

Key Observations
- Huge performance jump (2x as fast as kernel 4): each thread now does 64 computations so arithmetic intensity increased significantly
- IT IS COMPUTE BOUND FOR THE FIRST TIME! NCU OPT states "Compute is more heavily utilized than Memory"
- occupancy dropped since there is a register limit on number of blocks per SM (each thread now uses more registers)
- memory system less stressed: less gmem access, better data reuse, caching working well
- arithmetic intensity calculation: kernel 5 has 2x fewer gmem access, 2.5x fewer smem accesses compared to kernel 4
- despite less occupancy, matmul is 2x faster because each thread is more productive

Bottleneck identified by NCU
- my matmul has 1024 blocks and one wave can schedule at most 216 blocks across gpu, total waves = 4.74
- during the final wave, some SMs sitting idle

    OPT   Compute is more heavily utilized than Memory: Look at the Compute Workload Analysis section to see what the   
          compute pipelines are spending their time doing. Also, consider whether any computation is redundant and      
          could be reduced or moved to look-up tables.

          A wave of thread blocks is defined as the maximum number of blocks that can be executed in parallel on the    
          target GPU. The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical       
          occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 4 full waves and a partial wave of 160 thread blocks.  
          Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, this partial wave may account for  
          up to 20.0% of the total runtime of this kernel. Try launching a grid with no partial wave. The overall       
          impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for a grid. See the Hardware   
          Model (https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/ProfilingGuide/index.html#metrics-hw-model) description for     
          more details on launch configurations.

          The 4.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the       
          hardware maximum of 16. This kernel's theoretical occupancy (25.0%) is limited by the number of required      
          registers.
