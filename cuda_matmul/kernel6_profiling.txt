A100 Metrics:
Compute Limit: 19,500 GFLOPs
Memory Limit: 2,000 GB/s

MY Analysis:
    FLOPS = 2 * 4096 ^ 3 = 137 billion GFLOPS
    Time = 12.37 ms
    Performance = 137B / 0.01145 = 11,965  GFLOPS
    This is 11,965  / 19500 = 61.4% of peak capacity

Key Observations
- not as dramatic as kernel 4 -> kernel 5 since matmul no longer memory bound, but still improvement
- vectorization helps but not dramatic as 2d blocktiling, kernel 5 was already compute bound
- compute throughput bit 80% 
- register pressure also improved: vectorized loads/stores more efficient, compiler can optimize
- need another 25% improvement to reach cuBLAS level: bottlenecks could be register constraints, partial wave problem, instruction level dispatches
- noticed different perforamnce improvements with different architecture types (hopper, A6000, etc)
- from this point on, memory optiizations show less improvement since we are not compute bound (now depends on hardware optimizations)

    INF   This workload is utilizing greater than 80.0% of the available compute or memory performance of the device.   
          To further improve performance, work will likely need to be shifted from the most utilized to another unit.

          A wave of thread blocks is defined as the maximum number of blocks that can be executed in parallel on the    
          target GPU. The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical       
          occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 4 full waves and a partial wave of 160 thread blocks.  
          Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, this partial wave may account for  
          up to 20.0% of the total runtime of this kernel. Try launching a grid with no partial wave. The overall       
          impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for a grid. See the Hardware   
          Model (https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/ProfilingGuide/index.html#metrics-hw-model) description for     
          more details on launch configurations.

          The 4.00 theoretical warps per scheduler this kernel can issue according to its occupancy are below the       
          hardware maximum of 16. This kernel's theoretical occupancy (25.0%) is limited by the number of required
